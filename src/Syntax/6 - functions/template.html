<h1>Functions</h1>
<p>Functions can be divided into two categories.Which are expression type and declaration type.In javascript functions are first class objects.So the hoisting and lexical scoping is applicable here.In javascript compiler passing mechanism is 2-passing.Which means that first pass is for variables and second pass is for functions.
