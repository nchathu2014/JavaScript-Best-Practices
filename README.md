# JavaScript-Best-Practices
This is for maintain good quality code by understanding the java script best practices in various situations

### Syntax oriented best practices
- Automatic semicolon insertion (**ASI**)
- Linting (JSHint -> http://jshint.com/docs/options/ configure jshint with package.json)
- Curly Braces (Place them in same line for consistancy)
- Equality (**===** and for checking use **!== 'undefined'**)
- Variables (Hoisting/Lexical Scoping -> make the variables on top of the scope)
- functions (first class objects , best practice is define variables first and then declare function and run the function)

### Behavior oriented best practices
- Global variables
- Use strict mode
- Read Only properties (with **Object.defineProperty()**)
- Delete properties (with **delete** keyword)
- Octal and Hexa decmial numer representation
- Working with **"with"**
